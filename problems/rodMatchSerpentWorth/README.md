The solve here is only done in eigenvalue mode. The objective is to change the absorbtion of the control rod until
the same reactivity worth experienced at the MSRE is obtained in Moltres.

In this top directory, the radius of the 2D case found the match Serpent's unrodded reactivity was found to be 78.58cm.
Serpent found k=1.045 +- 0.0010. This simulation yields k= 1.045177e+00.

In the adjustAbsorb directory, the control rod's absorbtion factor was found to match the MSRE results. To reproduce results,
the .msh file generated by gmsh must be copied into that directory.
