Serpent found that with one rod inserted, k fell to k=1.017+-0.001. Rod insertion means that the rod has a position
23.622 cm above the bottom of the core. We know this from MSRE Design and Operations Report part 1 where the control rod
system was described.

The multiplicative factor to achieve the ORNL-specified rod worth of 2.8% \Delta k/k was found to be 14.22. This was found with
a few secant method iterations on paper while I was reading stuff on sciencedirect.
