    doi = {10.1016/j.anucene.2017.12.025},
    abstract = {Moltres is a new physics application for modeling coupled physics in fluid-fuelled, molten salt reactors. This paper describes its neutronics model, thermal hydraulics model, and their coupling in the MOOSE framework. Neutron and precursor equations are implemented using an action system that allows use of an arbitrary number of groups with no change in the input card. Results for many-channel configurations in 2D-axisymmetric and 3D coordinates are presented and compared against other coupled models as well as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.},

    abstract = {Molten salt nuclear reactor technology has not yet been constructed for industrial scale. High fidelity simulation capability of both transients and steady-state behavior must be developed for reactor licensing. The simulations should make use of high performance computing (HPC) in order
to come to realistic results while minimizing assumptions. High resolution simulation of limiting reactor transients using
open-source software can inform reproducible results suitable for preliminary licensing activity. We present example results of the new code.},
